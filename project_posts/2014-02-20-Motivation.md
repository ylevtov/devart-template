## Mass interaction, but without chaos
I've always been interested in interactive installations where visitors have a very active role in how the sound or visuals behave. This could be very direct control via dedicated interaction interfaces such as Wii remotes, Kinect cameras, Leap motion sensors etc., or it could be more indirect control such as tracking the number of people in a room or responding to the loudness of the visitors surrounding environment.  

In any case, I have found that if you offer control over the music to a group of people via some kind of interaction method, people aren't interested in how good the music sounds overall - they are only interested in hearing the effect that they have as an individual, and this quickly descends into chaos.  

A slightly left-field but relevant equivalent to this principle is the economic theory called the [tragedy of the commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

I'm therefore very interested in finding a way of allowing many people to interact with an installation, but in such a way where visitors understand that there is a communal interest in contributing their interactions in a measured and timely way.

## Background
I have been working in the field of 'dynamic music' for close to five years, and, along with tuition and inspiration from Andy Farnell, it really is the reason I began to write code and programme in the first place.

### Dynamic music
Dynamic music challenges the notion that a piece of recorded music is a static entity, sounding the same every time it is listened to. It introduces variation, spontaneity, listener interaction and much more to the listening experience, and makes it more ephemeral, like it was in the days before the means to record and 'freeze' sound were commonplace.  

Dynamic music encompasses the formats of music beyond the MP3. Companies like RjDj and artists like Brian Eno, Bj√∂rk, and many others, have shown the creative depth that these new formats offer to artists and listeners alike, yet they are still niche.  

A big problem with dynamic music is that it can't be as readily distributed as, say, an MP3. Although the devices we use to listen to music are plenty capable of playing back dynamic music formats, we are still in the early stages of the art form where there are no standards to adhere to, making it difficult to distribute dynamic music en masse.  

Installations are one of the best ways of allowing people to experience dynamic music. A controlled environment with good speakers, lighting possibilities and a powerful computer make for an exciting blank canvas on which musicians can craft beautiful interactive auditory experiences.

### More on dynamic music
I have been giving talks on the topic of dynamic music that go into much more depth than I have written above. If you are interested in finding out more, please check out the following presentation:
