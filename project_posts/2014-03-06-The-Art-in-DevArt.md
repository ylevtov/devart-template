The central focus of this installation is a piece of generative music. It is an art piece within itself and, as such, needs to stand on it's own artistic merits. Even if visitors aren't interacting with the installation via their smartphones and have their eyes closed so they can't see the visuals, the music should still be a beautiful, noteworthy experience. When creating very technology-driven installations such as these, it’s easy to let the ‘art’ take a back-burner, at which point you start merely creating a showcase of technology.  

Therefore it was to my great pleasure to find this little gem, yesterday:
[Simon Pyke - Universal Everything & You (Bleep.com)](https://bleep.com/release/46788-simon-pyke-freeform-universal-everything-you)
[Simon Pyke - Universal Everything & You (SoundCloud)](https://soundcloud.com/warp-records/universal-everything-you)  

It is the soundtrack to the Universal Everything & You exhibition at the Media Space in the Science Museum. Although the installation was about much more than just music, so much care and attention was poured into the soundtrack that it completely stands on it's own and is a great listen.  

Owen's going to be working on some more WebGL visuals, today, that I hope we can post some screenshots of later, and tomorrow I'm going to dive into the music side of things, hoping to achieve something that comes close Simon Pyke's work!
