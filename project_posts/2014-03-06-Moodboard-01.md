### Moodboard

So we have the technology stack working - great! Now it's time to look at some of the details in how the installation will look and feel.

I find moodboards are a good way to kick off this apporach - well chosen images that point to the character of the finished piece without having to be too specific. We can then stand back, have a look at the world we've created and think, "Nope, that's not going to work." or.. "That's good. What if we did..."

So here's our first draft of a moodboard for both the WebGL/Chrome visualiser and the mobile interface:

**First, the world**

**And second, the interface**

*Notes : These moodboards came out of conversations about look & feel that Yuli & I have been having whilst working on the technology. Whilst we're pretty happy with this approach at the moment, we'd like to experiment further with a 'look' that doesn't smack so much of 'digital art' - as beautiful as it could be. Back to the drawing board...*
