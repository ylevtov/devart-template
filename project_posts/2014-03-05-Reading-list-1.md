### Reading List 1
A couple of interesting and relevant items have popped up on my radar recently and I thought it worth noting them, here:  

First is a fantastic article written by [Dan Jones](http://www.twitter.com/ideoforms) about the relationship between artists and the tools they use to create their art.  

[ART AND ALGORITHM](http://tankmagazine.com/issue-60/features/art-and-algorithm)

To me, this topic has always been a keen point of interest, as I am often aware of the influence that the program or language I am using (be it Pure Data, Max MSP, Ableton Live, a drum-kit etc.) has on whatever it is I am making. James Holden's latest album, [The Inheritors](http://open.spotify.com/album/6ljTPjGb8hwaRT6HPJYbfb), while still very electronic sounding, has a certain unpredictability about it because it was created entirely using a modular synthesizer rather than a traditional sequencer. The influence of the toolset James Holden used here is undeniable, and it is embraced and maximised rather than feared and minimised.

The second is a composition for the London Contemporary Orchestra and audience members by Jonny Greenwood - [Self Portrait with 7 Fingers](http://2014.withassociates.com/projects/lco-and-jonny-greenwood).  

Of course, it was the audience interaction element of this piece that caught my eye, and it would seem that when it comes to mass interaction, we seem to have stumbled across some common ground. The nifty web interface that With Associates put together also features a logical 'timeout' feature, ensuring that audience members cannot just hammer their button continuously throughout the performance. Another nice feature was a hard limit on how many times each audience member could press thier button (49). This meant that people had a much more measured approach to the usage of their finite contributions to the performance.
