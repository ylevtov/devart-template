Large projects like this one often feel like trying put up a tent in a strong wind. Although difficult, things become a lot easier once you've got at least one tent-peg in the ground, even if you have to adjust it again a bit later...  

With that in mind, even though we still have some technical scaffolding to build, we felt it important to start getting some of the music side of this done so that we better know what we are aiming for with the techy stuff. Also, the sound of the music will obviously have a key influence on the visuals.  

Owen and I discussed various aspects of how we want the music to behave and came up with the following initial thoughts:

#### Structure
One of the most important decisions we had to make was how the music would be arranged. We decided to approach the problem by visualising a system based on themes and layers. The themes are distinct from each other and would feature different chord structures, instrumentation and general mood, like different tracks on an album. Each theme will, however, be arranged in a similar way, consisting of various musical layers that would all work together in any combination. This means that we can choose to make any musical part controlled by the visitors in some way, and we know that whetever combination occurs, the music will still work.

The above sketch is a basic visualisation of the proposed musical structure. On the x-axis are the six main themes which are on a loop. The y-axis is some arbitrary metric of how people are interacting with the installation. This could either be something like the number of interactions per minute or something more specific like when two visitors work together to activate a certain instrument. When the level of interaction crosses certain thresholds, more musical layers reveal themselves. Finally, there is a final musical theme that can be accessed at any time if enough people are simultaneously interacting with the installation.  

#### Length
We wanted to have enough music so that people could spend a good amount of time in the installation without necessarily hearing any of the musical themes repeat themselves, but not so much that even the very engrossed visitors would feel like there was a constant supply of music and that they would never hear all of it. We have initially decided to aim for around 40 minutes' worth.

#### Interaction methods
This installation will feature a hybrid of generative and interactive techniques, and treading the line between the two is a delicate and fine art, especially where audience participation is concerned. I feel there must always be a very clear dividing line between what the visitor is in control of and what they are not in control of, as when that line becomes blurry, the visitor loses faith in their interaction as they can no longer attribute a change in their environment to one of their own actions. This is particularly relevant to the musical structure. My intial thought has been to allow the main musical themes to be on a kind of automatic trajectory that happens regardless of whether the installation space is full or empty, and that the visitors have control over simply how each theme sounds while it plays. At times I have also considered having a single theme repeat itself until there is a communal decision taken to advance to the next one. I'm still slightly on the fence with this particular point, but I think the automatic loop will win out because it allows us to control the duration of the experience a bit better.  

We've identified four main types of interaction that will occur:
- individual involuntary e.g. visitor simply connecting to the installation
- individual voluntary e.g. visitor pressing a button on their device
- group voluntary e.g. a pair of visitors collaborate to activate a certain instrument together
- group involuntary e.g. all visitors increasing their rate of interactions with the installation  

Each of these interaction types will yield different styles of musical results, with voluntary and deliberate actions always being paired with clear and identifiable reactions from the sound and visuals.

#### At long last...
...time to start writing some music!

The topic of making generative music using Ableton Live is worthy of a whole post of it's own and I'll be posting some bits of the process that I find particulary interesting at a later date. Suffice it to say, Live is hugely powerful and flexible when it comes to arranging MIDI and Audio in such a way that produces endlessly evolving arrangements of non-linear music, and when paired with Max via Max For Live, the possibilities really are endless.  

Here's a quick demo of the first two musical themes.

I've arranged them such that they have a very loose musical structure and I am bringing certain instruments in and out as if they were being controlled by visitors in the installation, but for the most part, Live is just running, doing it's own thing.  

The process of starting the musical composition has been very helpful as it has started to inform not only ideas for the visuals, but also for the structure of the entire installation and the visitor experience.  

More as I have it...
