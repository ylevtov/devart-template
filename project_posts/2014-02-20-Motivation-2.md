## Technology Inspiring Play
I think that one of the strongest - if not the strongest - appeal for a digital artist working in the interactive / physical space is the ability to see their audience react directly to their work, in the same way that a live musician or theatre practitioner. 

However, something that can - for me at least - extend beyond this satisfaction, is seeing people interact with each other - with friends or complete strangers - in completely new and unfamiliar ways as a result of the work. They discover the ‘rules’ of the situation they find themselves in, and, if those rules are sufficiently well designed, start to play.

This for me brings out some of the best audience experiences to be a part of, and to watch unfold as a creator. The work then lives and grows in the unexpected interactions and patterns of behaviour emerging from those simple set of rules.

For me these behaviours cover everything from a group of friends playing multiplayer Mario Kart, to these great examples of digital work inspiring group interaction:

**Joust!** [http://www.jsjoust.com/]('http://www.jsjoust.com/', 'Joust')

**Space Team** [http://www.sleepingbeastgames.com/spaceteam/]('http://www.sleepingbeastgames.com/spaceteam/', 'SpaceTeam')


In these examples the joy of playing the game comes from the actions of the people around you - the technology is merely an enabler.

What excites me about this project is the chance to work on a set of rules, gentle instructions and feedback that ideally will create some fun and novel behaviour between complete strangers.
