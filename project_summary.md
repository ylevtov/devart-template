## Description
A room of constantly evolving, generative and reactive music, lights and visuals that visitors can interact with via their smartphones. Every visitor is presented with a slightly different interface on their smartphones, each with different level of influence over their surroundings. Some interfaces will encourage interaction with other visitors, prompting teamwork and interaction on a social plane as well as digital one.
