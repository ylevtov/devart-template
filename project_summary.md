## Description
A room of constantly evolving, generative and reactive music, lights and visuals that visitors can interact with via their smartphones. Upon joining the installation's Wi-Fi network, every visitor is presented with a slightly different interface on their smartphones, each with a different level or type of influence over their surroundings. The interaction types will be various, ranging from being able to trigger short sounds, through to changing the overall mood of the music. Some interfaces will encourage interaction with other visitors, prompting teamwork and social (as well as musical) interaction.
